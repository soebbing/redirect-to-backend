# Shopware 6 Plugin: `/backend` &rarr; `/admin`

A small helper for those who just can't get used to type `/admin` when you want to get to administration in Shopware 6.

And no, it is not meant to be taken seriously.

## Installation

Require in your `composer.json` or just grab a .zip and upload it in your plugin manager. After installation and activation you FINALLY can type `/backend` again in your brand new Shopware 6 shop!
